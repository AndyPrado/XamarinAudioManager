> Cross platform Audio Manager for Xamarin

Xamarin Audio Manager provides a simple way to play audio files in Xamarin projects.

The Supported Xamarin Platforms are:
- iOS
- Android
- UWP
- Windows 8.1
- Windows Phone 8.1 //Sorta need work but how many people use win phone ;)

Here is a sample showing how you can use Xamarin Audio Manager to set background music and play an effect sound.

```C#
await Audio.Manager.PlayBackgroundMusic("bgMusic.mp3");

await Audio.Manager.PlaySound("Drop.mp3");
```

## Install

Install the [XamarinAudioManager NuGet Package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/XamarinAudioManager).

If you reference the package from a Xamarin Portable project, you will also need to reference the package from each Xamarin platform specific project. This is because the Xamarin Portable version of Xamarin Audio Manager doesn't contain the actual implementation of the audio APIs (because it differs from platform to platform), so referencing the package from a platform specific project will ensure that Xamarin Audio Manager is included in the app and used at runtime.
